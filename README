README for clamtk-kde
---------------------
Last updated 3 Sep 2016

clamtk-kde is a simple plugin to allow a right-click,
context menu scan of files or folders in Dolphin,
a file manager in KDE.

All this plugin does is copy a desktop file to a
directory.  If this seems redundant, that's because it is:
this plugin depends on clamtk, which already has this directory
file. So, it stands to reason we should be able to just find that
file and copy it, rather than having our own copy.

To manually install it:
Ensure ClamTk is installed. You'll need version 4.00 or newer.
Copy the clamtk-kde.desktop file to the services folder. For example:
For KDE 4:
# cp clamtk-kde.desktop /usr/share/kde4/services/
For KDE 5:
# cp clamtk-kde.desktop /usr/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
You will need to have root privileges for that step.
